# Sentiment Analysis

1. This sentiment analysis project's dataset was obtained from Kaggle, specifically from a file called "Tweets.csv." There are roughly 14,642 entries in this file, each of which is a tweet about one of the six major airlines: American Airlines, United, Virgin America, Delta, and Southwest. The dataset contains a number of features that offer comprehensive details about every tweet, including the text of the tweet, user information, and the sentiment expressed in the tweet.

2. This assignment's main objective is to properly classify each tweet's sentiment into one of three groups: neutral, negative, or positive. This classification will help understand public perception and sentiment towards these airlines, which can be valuable for the airlines' customer service and marketing strategies.

3. Scope:  
   i. Clean and prepare tweet data by removing noise and standardizing text. Use TF-IDF to convert text into numerical features for machine learning models.  
   ii. This assignment uses two types of machine learning: Random Forest and Logistic Regression. Assess model performance using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.  
   iii. Analyze tweet sentiments about six airlines using trained models. To help airlines improve customer service, gather and publish insights on sentiment distribution and customer perceptions.
